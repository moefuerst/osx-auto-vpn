OSX AUTO VPN
04/2012

Automatically connects you to a VPN when not at a known location (based on WiFi 
connection) 

Kudos to Onne Gorter for ideas on the LocationChanger


CONFIGURATION
Note: Make the following configurations BEFORE running install.sh!

* Open connect.scpt using AppleScript-Editor and change "My VPN" to the name of your
  VPN connection as found in System Preferences > Network (In the list of your services
  on the left)
  
* Edit the "config" file using a text editor of your choice and enter your network 
  information according to the following example. If you are always on WiFi, you can 
  leave the EN_IPS part empty:

  LOCATIONS=(HOME OFFICE GIRLFRIEND)
  SSIDS=(MyOfficeWLAN MyHomeWLAN MyGfWLAN)
  EN0IPS=(192.168. 10.0.0. 192.168.0.)
  EN1IPS=(192.168. 10.0.0. 192.168.0.)
  

INSTALL
If you're done editing connect.scpt and config, open Terminal, navigate to the folder 
you have put osx auto vpn in and run ./install.sh


LOG File
Per default, osx auto vpn puts a log file including all its detections in ~/.osxvpn.log
Comment that out in autovpn.sh (before running the install script) if you don't need this.
